INTRODUCTION

This repository contains PyTorch models, and example code for running them, to forecast wildfire growth. The models were trained on satellite imagery from the 2018 Ferguson wildfire.

The documentation of the package, with a detailed explanation of all classes and functions, can be accessed [here](docs/html/index.html). In there, you can also find a short description explaining the forecasting models and algorithms used.
